# Custom version of the Google web-starter-kit

This is my custom version of Google's web-starter kit. I made the following modificaions:

* Added PostCSS
* Enabled support for Ruby Sass files (.sass)
* Include the lost grid system via PostCSS
* Use normalize.css by default
* Got rid of Material Design as default
* Using Pug (former Jade) for templating

For usage documentation, please visit [the original repo by Google](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit).
