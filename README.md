# My website

It's a website, a simple one. It doesn't feature much.

## Literally HTML and CSS

I actually don't use any build tools for this website. It's so simple that
installing any modules to create it would be a colossal waste of time. Fairly
refreshing not seeing a `package.json` in the repository root.
